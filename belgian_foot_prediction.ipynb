    "#### Features Explanation & Reasons for Keeping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **season**: The season during which the match occurred.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Important for tracking seasonal performance and accounting for roster changes, form variability, or season-specific factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AHCh**: Asian Handicap for the home team.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Provides a more nuanced view of team strength, often used for predicting match outcomes and accounting for perceived strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **home_away_ratio**: Ratio of the home team's average odds (AvgH) to the away team's average odds (AvgA).\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Gives a measure of market-based team strength, useful for comparing the teamsâ€™ relative strengths in a given match.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **B365H, B365D, B365A**: Bet365 odds for home win, draw, and away win.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Betting odds are predictive of outcomes; Bet365 data gives a concrete indication of how markets expect matches to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BWH, BWD, BWA**: Betway odds for home win, draw, and away win.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Having multiple odds sources allows you to compare predictions and see how different bookmakers perceive match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PSH, PSD, PSA**: Pinnacle odds for home win, draw, and away win.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Another key odds provider, often more reflective of professional betting behavior, which can aid in prediction models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **home_team_form6 / away_team_form6 / home_team_form_home6 / away_team_form_away6**: Form of the home and away teams over their last 6 games (overall and in specific conditions).\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Provides recent performance data, crucial for short-term prediction, as form is often a key factor in determining match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **home_avg_yellow6 / home_avg_red6 / home_avg_shots6 / home_avg_target6 / home_avg_corners6 / home_avg_goals6**: Average statistics for the home team over the last 6 games (yellow/red cards, shots, goals, etc.).\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Recent team statistics are more predictive than overall season averages, as they capture current trends and performances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **away_avg_yellow6 / away_avg_red6 / away_avg_shots6 / away_avg_target6 / away_avg_corners6 / away_avg_goals6**: Same as above, but for the away team.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Similarly, for the away team, recent match data helps in predicting upcoming game outcomes, particularly for away performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **home_team_form10 / away_team_form10 / home_team_form_home10 / away_team_form_away10**: Form of home and away teams over the last 10 games (overall and specific conditions).\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Medium-term form helps in balancing short-term form and more general team strength, capturing team performance over a larger set of games.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **home_avg_yellow10 / home_avg_red10 / home_avg_shots10 / home_avg_target10 / home_avg_corners10 / home_avg_goals10**: Average stats for the home team over the last 10 games.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Slightly longer-term statistics give a broader picture of the teamâ€™s performance, while still focusing on recent games.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **away_avg_yellow10 / away_avg_red10 / away_avg_shots10 / away_avg_target10 / away_avg_corners10 / away_avg_goals10**: Same as above, but for the away team.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Similar rationale for away team stats over 10 gamesâ€”balances short-term and long-term trends for predictive purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **home_team_form14 / away_team_form14 / home_team_form_home14 / away_team_form_away14**: Form of home and away teams over the last 14 games (overall and specific conditions).\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Long-term form gives a clearer idea of the teamâ€™s overall consistency and strength throughout the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **home_avg_yellow14 / home_avg_red14 / home_avg_shots14 / home_avg_target14 / home_avg_corners14 / home_avg_goals14**: Average stats for the home team over the last 14 games.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: These columns reflect more general team behavior over a longer term, important for identifying overall trends or tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **away_avg_yellow14 / away_avg_red14 / away_avg_shots14 / away_avg_target14 / away_avg_corners14 / away_avg_goals14**: Same as above, but for the away team.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Similar importance as for home team stats, giving a long-term view of away performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **h2h_record**: Head-to-head record between the two teams.\n",
    "    - **Reason**: Head-to-head matchups often influence outcomes, especially in long-standing rivalries, so this can be critical for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Keep These Columns in the DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Form Analysis**: The team form columns (e.g., home_team_form6, away_team_form6) reflect recent performance trends, crucial for short- and medium-term predictions.\n",
    "2. **Team Strength Comparison**: Metrics like AvgH, AvgA, and team stats over 6, 10, and 14 games provide detailed views of team performance across different timeframes.\n",
    "3. **Betting Market Data**: Including betting odds columns from multiple sources allows for comparing actual match outcomes with market predictions.\n",
    "4. **Head-to-Head Impact**: The h2h_record column helps in identifying how specific team matchups affect game outcomes, especially in rivalries.\n",
    "5. **Discipline Metrics**: Yellow and red card columns are important for assessing potential game disruptions due to bookings.\n",
    "6. **Historical Consistency**: The use of form data over different game windows (6, 10, 14) gives flexibility in analyzing both recent and long-term trends.\n",
    "7. **Market Comparison**: By keeping odds data from multiple sources (B365, BW, PS), we can evaluate market consistency and potential biases."

    "\n",
    "This code performs a parallelized search over 1,000 random feature combinations to evaluate their performance in predicting football match outcomes using a Random Forest Classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "The feature combinations are constructed by randomly selecting one `n` value (e.g., 6, 8, 10) for each aggregated feature \n",
    "(e.g., `home_team_form`, `away_avg_shots`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Constant features like betting odds and seasonal information are included in every combination. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model accuracy is calculated for each feature set, and the results are ranked to identify the best-performing combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance of the Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Classifier is relevant here because it is a robust ensemble learning method that excels at handling large datasets with many features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its ability to handle complex feature interactions and reduce overfitting by averaging multiple decision trees makes it a good choice for predicting football match outcomes based on a variety of feature combinations."
